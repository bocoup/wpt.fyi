This project's primary focus is visualizing test results. It is not responsible
for collecting web-platform-tests. The data is uploaded by external services,
primarily https://github.com/web-platform-tests/results-collection . Issues
regarding the collection methodology and/or accuracy of the data should be
filed against those external services.
